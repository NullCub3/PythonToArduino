# PythonToArduino
 
So I've had this little Arduino controlled robot car for a while now, and I've been wanting to be able to control it with an actual gamepad. So I have decided to finally start working on that. 

My plan is to send the individual motor PWM values over Bluetooth to the car, and I will have the fancy processing of the gamepad be done on my computer with Python. 

Turns out sending the signals to the car is a lot harder than I expected, but still relatively simple. Either way, here's my code if anyone wants to look at it, I will be updating this with the python scripts as well as soon as I write them. I commented it to the best of my ability, but it's still not great so have fun XD
